    <h1> Experience </h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p> HyperionDev Bootcamp</p>
    <p1>To gain a deeper understanding of programming concepts, I undertook a bootcamp where I covered Object Oriented Programming in Python, Agile Development, Databases, SQL, HTML + CSS and Django. 
        During the course I was able to confidently use my skills to build projects which showcases what I learnt.</p1>
    <p>Nuffield Research Project</p>
    <p1>Keen to use my programming skills to learn more about AI through a practical
        experience, I completed a Nuffield research placement, where I worked
        alongside a group of 4 peers to assess how accurately machine learning
        could predict bankruptcy given linguistic variables about a company. Using
        data from thirty-five companies, I created and trained a neural network in
        MATLAB. I was excited to learn about hidden layers in a neural network, and
        how these are integral to the functioning of the system. Between input and
        output layers, hidden layers receive the input, attribute it a weight and feed it
        through an activation function, producing the output. The weight of each input
        signifies its influence on the output. In my neural network, this output was a
        prediction of whether a company would go bankrupt. I tested my network and
        analysed its learning curve to monitor its progress, seeing if I needed to
        from a background of IT and Computer Science with experience with Java, C,
        many core concepts such as: Algorithms, Architecture, Computer Systems,
        Mathematics, Logic, Reasoning and gained experience at developing projects
        provide more data to output a more accurate prediction. It was remarkable to
        find that my network predicted the outcome accurately 97% of the time, giving
        me an insight into the potential uses of AI, and I enjoyed considering how this
        might be applied to more complex fields like the stock market.</p1>
