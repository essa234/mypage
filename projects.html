    <p>C Emulator</p>
    <p1>In C, I engaged in a group project that consisted of building an ARM11
        emulator and assembler. l learnt many skills in this project such as:
        - Splitting work efficiently in a team to ensure deadlines are met.
        - Independent learning and understanding of the ARM architecture and instruction set.
        - Using bit-wise operations to read and write binary code.</p1>
